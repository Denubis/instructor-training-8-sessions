## Groups

-   People you\'re likely to teach with
    -   Geographic/institution proximity

## Policies for an 8 session workshop

2.  Miss one class and make up, miss two and you fail.
3.  Emphasize the fact that people in their GROUP need them to be there
4.  Icebreakers will start 10 minutes before, 8:50 am
    a.  Darya and Brian reflecting on sticky notes
    b.  Explicit Q&A period for questions from homework and previous
        > class.
5.  We will assign homework each session.

## [Episode: Welcome]

* Who are we and how do we approach teaching? 
* What should you expect from this workshop?


## [Building Skill With Practice]()

* How do people learn?
* Who is a typical Carpentries learner?
* How can we help novices become competent practitioners?

# Day 2

**Homework: Please read ["The Science of Learning"](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf), which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results in teaching.**

## [Expertise and Instruction]()

* What type of instructor is best for novices?
* How are we (as instructors) different from our learners and how does
this impact our teaching?

## [Memory and Cognitive Load]()

* What is cognitive load and how does it affect learning?
* How can we design instruction to work with, rather than against, memory
constraints?

## [Building Skill With Feedback]()

* How can I get feedback from learners?
* How can I use this feedback to improve my teaching?

# Day 3

# Day 4

## Teaching is a Skill

* How can I improve my teaching?

## Day 5

**Weekend homework: Review episode from prior week, and prepare to teach a live-coding segment from it. Read: [Ten Quick Tips for Creating an Effective Lesson](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6459472/)**
