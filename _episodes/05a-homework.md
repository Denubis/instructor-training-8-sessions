Draw a concept map for one of the following:
* Baking Bread
* Changing the oil on a car
* Doing the laundry
* Functions in R/python
* A Carpentries lesson you want to teach
* your choice!

## [Motivation and Demotivation]()

* Why is motivation important?
* How can we create a motivating environment for learners?

## [Mindset]()

* How does mindset influence learning?
* How should we praise our learners?
* How should we talk about errors?

> ## Reflecting on the Day
>
> Before we wrap up for the day, take 5 minutes to think over
> everything we covered today.  On a piece of paper, write
> down something that captures what you want to remember about
> the day.  The Trainers won't look at this - it's just for you.  
>
> If you don't know where to start, consider
> the following list for a starting point:
>
> * draw a concept map, connecting the material
> * draw pictures or a comic depicting one of the day's concepts
> * write an outline of the topics we covered
> * write a paragraph or "journal" entry about your
> experience of the training today
> * write down one thing that struck you the most
>
> This exercise should take about 10 minutes.
